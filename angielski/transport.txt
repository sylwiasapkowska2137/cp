Dear Mayor,
	My name is XYZ and I am writing to present numerous ideas, I came up with, concerning transport issues in our city. I believe, heavy traffic and thus, air and noise pollution, can be easily reduced.
	The project will consist of several steps. First of all, reducing the number of cars on roads is believed to be of paramount importance. This problem can be solved by introducing special renting bikes points all around the city. Citizens' habits are known to be hard to change, this is why in order to change citizens' mindsets, there should be organized special campaign promoting riding a bicycle to work/school. Another good idea may be discounts for renting a bike in the rush hours in the morning and afternoon. Additionally, because riding a bike is not possible during every season, promoting public transport is also believed to reduce traffic. And finally, a major part of employees in our city is working in the field of service. According to the media, most of their duties can be accomplished successfully and effectively at home, as well. Introducing online work seems to be one of the cheapest solutions, but at the same time significantly reduces the number of traveling citizens to and back from the office everyday. 
	Judging by all the above, a lot can be done to improve transportation in our city. I hope you find my proposal interesting. Please, contact me for more details.
																						Yours sincerely,
																							  XYZ
